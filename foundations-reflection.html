    <p><h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p></h4>
    i would not say that i have learnt anything ground breaking with this core learning. however it has open my mind to EQ and given me 
    some more confidence in this path of changing my career and learning new things. 

    <p><h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</p></h4>
    we are all in this together im sure that a lot of us are at the same stage as me where it is pretty nerve racking entering into a "bootcamp" where\
    you do not know how good you will be at it and there is a possibility of failure. I think being self aware is very important for this because we 
    will be working a team and pairs when coming into the bootcamp and ensuring that you are in this group fully aware of yourself and 
    how to support not only yourself in learning but support the other people in your group.
    
   
    <p><h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p></h4>
    i feel like the most challenging aspect of core learning is being open to these types of questions, for the example the previous question 
    at the beginning of this course if i was asked that i probably would have laughed. opening up to core learning throughout this course has been a bit difficult 
   
    <p><h4>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p></h4>
        Dev Academy focuses on realist programming abilities outside of a learning environment. Where coders are required to work in a team and learning about how to do this effectively
        and fit in with the team will go well for job hunting 

    <p><h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p></h4>    
    i have had a lot of dealing with people within the work environment being a HR Manager, i think that some of the questions are trying to push the whole feelings thing a bit. there were points 
    in this where i couldnâ€™t see the value of asking these questions. however it part of the course and there will be times throughout employment where you will probably have to deal with uncomfortable situations 
    with team members and it good to learn a bit of self awareness to utilise in these situations
