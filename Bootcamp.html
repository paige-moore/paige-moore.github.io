        <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1></h1>
<p><h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p></h4>
I end goal is to have a successful career in full stack development. 

<p><h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p></h4>
I think my strength and limitations are the same for bootcamp as they are for foundations. Is that I get stuck, I like everything to be perfect but I cannot look past the small things and into the bigger picture. The good thing throughout foundations is that I could see myself not moving on and I could recognise when to take a step back and re-evaluate. 

<p><h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p></h4>
I am bit nervous about working in a group, not because I don’t like people. But I am not confident in my skills yet. I don’t want to be the weakest coder in the group and let the team down. I need to focus on this as being a great opportunity to learn off of my peers and hopefully be able to support them as well. 

<p><h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p></h4>
I think probably my confidence in communicating. For me I don’t want to be wrong so in situations where I think I have a solution I will likely not say it incase it is wrong and I will be embarrassed. 

<p><h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p></h4>
I am hoping bootcamp is like a class room where help and support are readily available if needed. 

<p><h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p></h4>
I will seek help where I cannot find the solution for myself. I will either ask my team in foundations or my facilitator. I will not let myself think myself into not being good enough for this course. 
<h4>I can do it and I will do it.</h4>
