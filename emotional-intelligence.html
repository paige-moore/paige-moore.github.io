    <H1> Emotional Intelligence </H1>

<p> <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence </h3>
    Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use and manager your own emotions is a positive way. Emotional intelligence helps communicate effectively, relieve stress, perceive emotions in other, manage your emotions and improve self awareness. People with high emotional intelligence can recognize their own emotions and those of others, use emotional information to guide thinking and behaviour.
    <h3>How is it different to IQ </h3>
    IQ – intelligence quotient is a score derived from several standardised tests and is designed to assess an individual’s intelligence. EQ measures an individual’s social and emotional competencies or one’s ability to recognise one’s own and other person’s emotional expression. Whereas IQ measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability.
    <h3>Why is it important </h3>
    The value and benefits of emotional intelligence are vast in terms of personal and professional success. Emotional intelligence is widely recognised as a valuable skill that helps improve communication, management, problem-solving, and relationships within the workplace. It is also a skill that researchers believe can be improved with training and practice. Without the ability to function well within this relational environment, it’s doubtful how far intelligence alone will get you.
