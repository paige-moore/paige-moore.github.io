        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1></h1>
        <h2> Research Neuroplasticity </h2>
    <p><h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p></h4>

    When we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s default mode of operation. It is through this sort of learning that we may be able to figure out how to purposefully rewire the brain.
    Understanding that the brain can be rewired gives people the confidence to go out and learn new things, because it is never to late. 
    
    <p><h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</p></h4>

    I am going to work on putting in sustained effort and a healthy lifestyle, to promote positive change and growth in their brains and commit my new learnings. 

    <p><h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity? </p></h4>
    I am going to about the take micro-steps to increase my neuroplasticity.  Taking micro-steps every single day when working toward my goal. The last thing i want to do is to overwhelm yourself with a much-too-big picture goal that leaves me not knowing where to even start.

    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p><h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</p></h4>
    Growth mindset believes that person can get smarter, better, or more skilled at something through sustained effort—which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us. You might say that a growth mindset is simply accepting the idea of neuroplasticity on a broad level!

    <p><h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </p></h4>
    With further information around this, I really think that learning is for everyone. At this start of this course I also spoke to my partner about what if I just can’t do it or understand it. But now I think that if I put the effort in I will be able to succeed. 

    <p><h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? </p></h4>
    I will set clear micro -goals and micro – steps for each sprint and focus on that rather than the much-too-big-picture of the while course.

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <p><h4>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. </p></h4>

    This will affect my learning plan positively as I believe that with my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset is has given me more confidence in learning.
