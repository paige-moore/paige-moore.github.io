        <h1> My Learning Plan</h1>
       <p> <h4>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h4></p>
        My long-term goal is to become a competent full stack developer.
        <p><h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4></p>
        My strength is that I am very driven, I will do something until it is finished. This can also be a limitation for me because I can get stuck on something and not be able to move on until it is done to my standard.
        <p><h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4></p>
        I would like to develop the way I communicate with people within the dev space. Being able to assist teammates or clients and have the courage to be able to add to the conversation. 
        <p><h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4></p>
        I have a at home office that will be my designated space for study. Working from home I find myself sitting on the couch, but this is in no way productive, my office eliminates distractions. I will do my best to not let my drive for perfection override the content ‚Äì stick to the time limits given. 
        If things start to build up, I will take a step back. I have a small note pad that I can write everything down one step at a time so I can conquer little things rather than being overwhelmed with a large project. Speak with my facilitator weekly for support and guidance, not go at it alone 
        <p><h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4></p>
        I will seek help where I cannot find the solution for myself. I will either ask my team in foundations or my facilitator. 
        <p><h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4></p>
        I would expect guidance from the facilitation team in solving a problem I am facing collaboratively and positively when needed. 
        <p><h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It‚Äôs important to plan these in.</h4></p>
        Throughout foundations I am still working a 40 hour per week job. But I have resigned and when bootcamp starts I will have not external commitments. I have told everyone I will see them in 3 months üòä
